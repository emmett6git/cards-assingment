1: Seen many "Like" operator's in query Instead of using Like we can use full text search in query as it

involves indexing the individual words within a text field in order to make searching through many records quickly

2: Must remove unnessary columns in query if we are not using them

3 : make sure all predicates like join , where ,orderby are indexed
